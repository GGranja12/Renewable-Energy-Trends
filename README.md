## *Project Overview* üìù

#### Welcome to my Renewable Energy End-to-End Project!

This one-week project was developed during Ironhack's Data Analytics course, focusing on showcasing and enhancing Python skills, exploratory data analysis techniques, and SQL proficiency through MySQL Workbench query development.

## *The Dataset* üóÉ

The data was retrieved from a csv. file which can be downloaded by accessing this [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy/data).

The provided dataset contains information from 2000 to 2020, covering 176 countries and comprising a total of 21 variables, as listed below:

- **Entity**: The name of the country or region for which the data is reported.
- **Year**: The year for which the data is reported, ranging from 2000 to 2020.
- **Access to electricity (% of population)**: The percentage of population with access to electricity.
- **Access to clean fuels for cooking (% of population)**: The percentage of the population with primary reliance on clean fuels.
- **Renewable-electricity-generating-capacity-per-capita**: Installed Renewable energy capacity per person
- **Financial flows to developing countries (US $)**: Aid and assistance from developed countries for clean energy projects.
- **Renewable energy share in total final energy consumption (%)**: Percentage of renewable energy in final energy consumption.
- **Electricity from fossil fuels (TWh)**: Electricity generated from fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) in terawatt-hours.
- **Electricity from nuclear (TWh)**: Electricity generated from nuclear power in terawatt-hours.
- **Electricity from renewables (TWh)**: Electricity generated from renewable sources (hydro, solar, wind, etc.) in terawatt-hours.
- **Low-carbon electricity (% electricity)**: Percentage of electricity from low-carbon sources (nuclear and renewables).
- **Primary energy consumption per capita (kWh/person)**: Energy consumption per person in kilowatt-hours.
- **Energy intensity level of primary energy (MJ/$2011 PPP GDP)**: Energy use per unit of GDP at purchasing power parity.
- **Value_co2_emissions (metric tons per capita)**: Carbon dioxide emissions per person in metric tons.
- **Renewables (% equivalent primary energy)**: Equivalent primary energy that is derived from renewable sources.
- **GDP growth (annual %)**: Annual GDP growth rate based on constant local currency.
- **GDP per capita**: Gross domestic product per person.
- **Density (P/Km2)**: Population density in persons per square kilometer.
- **Land Area (Km2)**: Total land area in square kilometers.
- **Latitude**: Latitude of the country's centroid in decimal degrees.
- **Longitude**: Longitude of the country's centroid in decimal degrees.

#### *SQL Script* üìä

In this repository, you will find a SQL script containing 10 example queries to extract insightful information from the cleaned dataframe, which you can obtain after exploring the attached Jupyter notebook. To get started, you can import the world_renewable_energy.csv file into the SQL software of your choice.

#### *Exploratory Data Analysis* 

The EDA process included the following key tasks:

- Grouping and aggregating data by continent across various indicators;
- Filtering the dataframe to compare indicators of European countries between 2000 and 2019;
- Creating Seaborn visualizations, including bar charts for continental comparisons and box plots for European comparisons.
